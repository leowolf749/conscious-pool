        <p id="bio">Leo Wolf is a musician and artist from Charlotte, North Carolina. 
            Using various synthesis, sampling, looping techniques, and field recordings he 
            creates warm textural soundscapes, often falling under the experimental/ambient/drone
            genres. His weapon of choice for recording and live performance is a eurorack modular 
            synthesizer.

            Leo takes inspiration from symbolism, and both conceptual and natural phenomena including 
            dreams, reflections, memory, and time. The labyrinth is a recurring symbol and source
            of inspiration as it represents the cyclical nature of existence and the parallels 
            between the physical and metaphysical world. "Portal hunting" is a phrase Leo uses to 
            describe seeking out these connections between outer and inner, as a way of seeing or
            feeling beyond the veil of our perception and understanding.

            In 2019 Leo began performing and collaborating with Sinetology, a Charlotte-based 
            electronic music label and collective. Sinetology features a multi-genre catalog of 
            artists and releases ranging from techno/acid/house to ambient/noise and blurring the
            lines in between.
